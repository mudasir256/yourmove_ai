# YourMove UI

## Thank you üôè

First and foremost, I just wanted to thank you for choosing me to complete your project for you, I really appreciate it! I hope you are pleased with what I have provided. If at any moment you have any questions about it or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to me on Uplink.

Thanks again!

## Introduction

The UI is a TypeScript based React project built with [Vite](http://vitejs.dev) and some other libraries.

It uses:

- `TailwindCSS` for styling
- `Heroicons` for icons
- `HeadlessUI` for some transitions
- `Axios` for HTTP requests
- `Zustand` for state management
- `Formik` for forms
- `yup` for validation
- `stripe` for payment stuff

# Environment File

The UI requires the location of the YourMove API. It retrieves this using the environment file in the root directory of the project `.env` or the environment itself.

It looks like:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The above value is for local development only. You can copy `.env-example` and rename it `.env`. When
deployed, this value is the URL of the deployed API.

## Running the UI

After pulling the code you need to install dependencies (you only need to do this once and then everytime the dependencies change).

```
npm install
```

Then, to run the UI, simply run:

```
npm run dev
```
